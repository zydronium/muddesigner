Development updates can be subscribed to from the developers blog at http://sullinger.us.

The source is also available at http://muddesigner.codeplex.com. This repository and the codeplex repository are always in sync. Development is performed on a private git repository and pushed to both codeplex and github when the source is stable.

About the project
-------------------

Multi-User-Dungeons (or MUDs) are online multiplayer games that are text driven, and combine role-playing, hack and slash and social chatting into a computer game that can be played through a special client, or a web browser. Typical MUDs are layed out in the style of a book, where the user is immersed in a world through text. The player can move from room to room, and read a description of the room, interact with the objects and characters within a room, and participate in events that take place. Players can interact with each other as they will occupy the same world together, and usually play the game in a role playing manor.

The MUD Designer Engine is being developed with C# and .NET 4.5 portable class libraries. The engine runtime will be cross-platform, running on Windows (Vista, 7 and 8) desktop, Windows RT, Windows Phone, Linux distro's, OS X, iOS and Android. The engine will support Game Management, Networking, Scripting, Custom Commands and dynamic MUD creation. 

The toolkit has a full featured editing environment being developed along side the runtime, and a stand-alone telnet server.

For those wanting to try the current source code version of the engine, they can download and install Visual C# 2012, download the latest source code build, and compile it. Please note that I will not upload changes to the source unless it compiles without error, but it is not guaranteed that features will exist as new versions are uploaded.
