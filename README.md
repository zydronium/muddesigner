##### Mud Designer has an IRC Channel! 

Join us at _irc.freenode.net:6697_ on **#MudDesigner**

The source is also available at http://muddesigner.codeplex.com. This repository will always contain the latest changes. The project originally started on Codeplex and so I continue to sync changes to it. The GitHub repository is the new home and will hold all of the documentation and support. The Codeplex repository will only hold the source, documentation and support will not be provided there.

About the project
-------------------

Multi-User-Dungeons (or MUDs) are online multiplayer games that are text driven, and combine role-playing, hack and slash and social chatting into a computer game that can be played through a special client, or a web browser. Typical MUDs are layed out in the style of a book, where the user is immersed in a world through text. The player can move from room to room, and read a description of the room, interact with the objects and characters within a room, and participate in events that take place. Players can interact with each other as they will occupy the same world together, and usually play the game in a role playing manor.

The MUD Designer Engine is being developed with C# and .NET 4.5 portable class libraries. The engine runtime is being developed as a cross-platform framework, running on Windows (Vista, 7 and 8) desktop, Windows RT, Windows Phone, Linux distro's, OS X, iOS and Android. The engine will support Game Management, Networking, Scripting, Custom Commands, security and component based plug-in support. 

The engine is being developed side-by-side with a client-side game editor that will provide mud developers a visual way to create their muds.

For those wanting to try the current source code version of the engine, they can download and install Visual Studio 2015 Preview, clone the repository, and compile it.
